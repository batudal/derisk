    <h3 class="text-xl text-derisk-100 font-medium">Why am I doing this?</h3>
    <p class="text-derisk-200 text-base font-normal">When I was working in the family business, I was responsible for
      the R&D of a modular construction system.
      <br /><br />
      Scope of my responsibility involved designing the factory line and the construction process, as well as the
      product itself.
      <br /><br />
      I studied <a class="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-derisk-100" href="" alt="">Toyota Production
        System</a>, <a class="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-derisk-100" href="" alt="">Lean Manufacturing</a>,
      and <a class="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-derisk-100" href="" alt="">Six Sigma</a>
      to
      implement a production system that would
      be efficient and effective.
      <br /><br />
      As I moved on to entrepreneurship, I realized that the same principles could be applied to startups(<a
        class="underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-derisk-100" href="" alt="">Lean Startup</a>).
      <br /><br />
      I started to look for a tool that would help me implement these principles in my startup, but I couldn't find one.
      <br /><br />
      Many solutions end up with a PDF template that you have to fill out, or a checklist that you have to follow.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl text-derisk-100 font-medium">What problem am I solving?</h3>
    <p class="text-derisk-200 text-base font-normal">I am building a risk management tool for early-stage projects.
      <br /><br />
      It is a tool that helps you identify, analyze, and mitigate risks in your project.
      <br /><br />
      It helps you manage multiple projects with an analytics dashboard to oversee gross risk and costs. Instead of
      printed templates and checklists, it is a digital tool that
      helps you manage your projects in a collaborative way.
